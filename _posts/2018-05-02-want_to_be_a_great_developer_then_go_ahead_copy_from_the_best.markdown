I spent many years playing the clarinet; not just doodling at it but really trying to be great at it. I practiced several hours a day until my fingers would swell. I didn’t mind. I loved it. I pictured myself playing in world-class orchestras, traveling the world on tours, and grabbing a freelance gig hear and there.

Then reality set in and I eventually grew up only to decide I didn’t want to be a starving musician. I craved the stability of a regular job that paid my bills and medical insurance. Sounds boring but I preferred that piece of mind over the struggle that might have lasted my entire life.

But I learned something from that experience. I used to play along with records of the best clarinetists, trying to imitate their sound and phrasing. I thought if I had enough practice at sounding like them, then I can develop my own style someday. 

What does this have to do with web development?

Learning to code can be similar to learning music. We have to learn the rules and technical know-how, and only then can we break free to create our very own ideas.  As I learn a new programming language, I find it’s helpful to code along with another programmer.  As I watch them solve a particular problem and code along with them, it trains my mind to inject this knowledge for me to use on my own someday. I may find a similar problem as I code and I will remember some of the troubleshooting techniques that my mentor used to solve a problem.

Of course, I don’t condone copying someone’s work but as I learn, I find it useful as an exercise to ‘play along’ and strengthen my coding muscles.  Give it a try and let me know how it works for you!
