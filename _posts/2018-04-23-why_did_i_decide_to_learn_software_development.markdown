Information Technology infrastructure has been my home for several years now and it has given me job satisfaction, great pay, and I’ve met some really awesome people who I now call lifelong friends. Serving the user community within a variety of companies has given me a purpose for my life and I’ll always be grateful of the opportunities that were provided to me.

So if my current IT job is the bomb, why would I change it all up and learn software development?
As great as my career has been for me, there are a couple of things missing that gnaw at my consciousness:

* I want to make a bigger, direct impact on peoples’ lives than in my previous career.
* I miss exercising my creative powers that somehow lurk in my personality.

Let’s face it! Nothing is more irritating than finding a website that provides information you want but is impossible to navigate the menus and find that information.  With software development, I can fix that! I can put the thought process together, creative skills, and design improvements to give a person a more pleasant and useful experience. How cool is that!? The user might not say to me, “hey Lynn, thanks for helping me get around that website faster and easier!” but that’s OK. I don’t mind being behind the scenes and providing good code without getting the credit. Kinda like the Robinhood of Coders. If I have helped someone and I know it’s a good solid product, that’s all the thanks I need (a long with a pay check, of course).

When I’m working on a website, and the vision in my head is starting to come around and present itself on my browser – it is just friggin’ exciting! The magic of code making a fun and interactive website, that also looks beautiful, is still amazing to me. I understand the technical side of code and how computers, operating systems, and protocols work but dang, it is still a beautiful thing to watch. As much as I love infrastructure technologies, I never had the same excitement as I do with software development – and the potential that code has changing or improving peoples’ lives. Just think of it! There are applications that help people with their health, eating habits, and exercising. Never before has information been so accessible to the average citizen.

And there is no evidence to show that software development will slow down or become obsolete. There is and will continue to be a high demand for good coders.

Software development jobs are in demand as never before and web technologies grow and change constantly. As long as a developer is committed and a life learner, then there will be opportunities for him/her for a life-time.
Why did I become a software developer? It’s a world that is on the brink of exciting and innovating opportunities!
