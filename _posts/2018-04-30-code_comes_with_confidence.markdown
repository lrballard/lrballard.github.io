I wanted to learn web development for quite a while, but that little, but annoying voice in my head said, “you already have a career; knock it off!”. The dabbling I did with code over the years gave me a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment that only comes with building things. That same feeling came from building our chicken coop, redesigning our landscape, and sitting out in the dark waiting for sunrise with my camera to capture some landscape shots. I can sit back and say “I did that!”.  

After watching co-workers get laid off…again…., I decided I’m an idiot for waiting any longer.  I need a skill that I can use on my own, build things on my own, freelance if I want, or work on a team with other developers from all over the world. I don’t want to rely on a local economy where my options are limited. Working online remotely allows me choices I would not have in my current job. 

And then the “what if’s” came along.

What if I don’t have enough confidence to get through interviews? What if people think I’m too old to join their team? What if I put all this time and money into trying to learn webdev and then not be able to do it. Am I fooling myself thinking I can pull off a career change?

Since I have no answers for any of these questions, I decided to dive in! Confidence will come while learning to code. 
I looked for inspiration from others who wanted to learn coding after already having a successful career. There were many very interesting stories of people with a wide range of circumstances that led them to learn coding. What I found is that everyone has extremely diverse backgrounds when they change to programing. Their stories were inspirational but nothing I could relate to in my life experiences. So I guess I’ll forge my path on my own. 

The wonderful thing about webdev is the community is so open, sharing, and encouraging. Yes, there are a few trolls out there but way less of them than on the photography forums I use (I guess it’s that “I’m a sensitive artist” thing).

I’m not 25 years old any longer but I have many more working years and I want to LOVE what I do. I guess I’m at that cross roads thing that people talk about when they want to navel gaze. Whatever…but I decided no more putting up with this BS of getting through a week just to live for Friday night through Sunday night. I’ve had jobs I really love but they are intermittent. It really depends on management and the culture of the company. Cultures can change very quickly if financial problems, lost market share, acquisitions, and bankruptcies come along. Working with a company that is in survival mode is truly a drag. Software engineering gives me choices that help me take control over my own destiny.

Small victory, but each time I get through a Learn lab without asking for a technical coach or forum post, I literally yell “Yay!”. I know my confidence will grow with each language I learn.

Tata for now, I’m off to code!
